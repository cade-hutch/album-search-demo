**Semantic Search Tool for Photo Albums**

A description-based search tool for finding images within a photo album.

This repo is a simplified version of the full tool for demonstrating the search capabilities on a sample collection of images. The demo repo for the complete tool can be found [here](https://github.com/cade-hutch/image_finder_demo).

STEP 1:
Go to [album-search-public-demo.streamlit.app](https://album-search-public-demo.streamlit.app/). Wait for the images to load.

STEP 2:
Browse through the images and find one you would like to search for, or use the randomly selected image displayed within the left sidebar as the search subject.

STEP 3:
Enter a brief description of the image to search for it. You can be as brief or as descriptive as you like, but keep in mind that more the vague a given description is, the more likely it is that other image(s) in the collection will match the description as well.

Top results for a search will appear at the top of the page. The remaining images will be re-ordered based on their relevance to your given search description. This means that even if a search query does not produce your expected image as a top result, it is likley to still be displayed near the top of the page.
